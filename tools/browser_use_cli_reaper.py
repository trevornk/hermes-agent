"""Browser Use harness daemon lifecycle: owner claim, idle/orphan reaping, exit teardown.

``browser_harness`` starts its daemon with ``start_new_session=True`` and expects it to
OUTLIVE the CLI invocation that spawned it — that detachment is what makes a session
persist across ``browser_exec`` calls. So the daemon is reparented to init on purpose;
``ppid=1`` is the design, not the leak, and a parent-death signal (pipe EOF, process
group, ``PR_SET_PDEATHSIG``) would kill the browser after every single tool call.

The leak is that nothing ever reclaimed those daemons. ``browser_tool_lifecycle`` owns
the same three mechanisms for the ``agent-browser`` lane — an owner-pid claim, an idle
grace, and teardown at exit — and the harness lane had none of them, so every distinct
``BU_NAME`` left a daemon holding a CDP connection until reboot.

Stopping is IPC-first: ``meta: shutdown`` is the only path that lets the daemon stop a
billable Browser Use cloud browser before it dies, and answering ``{"pong": true}`` on
its own socket is itself proof of identity. A signal is the fallback for a daemon whose
socket is already gone, and is sent only to a PID that is ours, still alive, and running
``browser_harness.daemon``. Chrome is NOT a child of this daemon (Hermes always exports a
``BU_CDP_*`` endpoint, so the harness never launches its own browser) — the agent-browser
lane reaps the browser, this one reaps the daemon holding the socket to it.
